## Documentation for Implementation of Specific Data Structures or Algorithms

Every Data Structure and Algorithm implementation is located in its own dedicated folder consisting ( as of now ) 2 files.

```
| Root Folder <name_of_implementation>
    | <name_of_implementation>.cpp : C++ Source Code
    | README.md                    : Guide and Implementation Details  
```

Any new addition needs to be done in the exact same format in order to maintain consistency across the project directory structure. Kindly refer to the README.md file available under the respective implemetation in order to better understand its implementation and usage.  
  

> Note : Default Issues as well as Pull Request templates have already been setup, in order to guide you while opening a new Issue or PR. Kindly adhere to the default template in order to enable faster actions.

> Also note that in case you would like to contribute in any other manner, which has not currently been covered by this existing CONTRIBUTIONS.md file, feel free to raise an Issue. It would also help us improve our CONTRIBUTIONS guide and welcome more people to join the community.
